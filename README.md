# Annoyed by people privating their contribution history on reddit?
Don't, worry! The solution is here:

**Make Reddit (Profiles) Public Again (MrPa)**

Using reddit own search it fetches private users posts and comments


Depends on your account settings if it can get NSFW results or not. When logged out it defaults to safe search.

small issue: sometimes reddit page errors out and crashes to a full white site, completly close the site and reopen to fix it.
